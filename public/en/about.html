<h2 class="c8" id="h.tieraadkysv4"><span class="c3 c4">What is Cos4Env?</span></h2>
<p class="c2"><span class="c6">Cos4Env It is a co-designed, interoperable and open source service that integrates</span> <span class="c6">environmental variable registers</span> <span class="c0">from multiple citizen observatories in one place allowing experts to save time in the download process and get access to an enormous number of environmental observations.</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">Cos4Env has been developed within the European Horizon 2020 Cos4Cloud project whose main objective is to improve citizen observatories technologies to help them increase the quantity and the quality of observations and, finally, to help ensure their long-term viability.</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">Cos4Env is available in the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC) and complies with the FAIR data principles, it is findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable.</span></p>
<p class="c2 c7"><span class="c3 c4"></span></p>
<h2 class="c8" id="h.ltncgcavu6ng"><span class="c3 c4">Development &amp; functionality:</span></h2>
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">Cos4Env is an open-source system that is integrated with other Cos4Cloud services such as the Authenix authentication system.</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">Cos4Env allows citizen science experts to view and comment on environmental variable registers from a single place, interacting with the community and contributing their knowledge.</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">When an observation has been identified in Cos4Env, this information is updated in the citizen observatory where it was published, awaiting final validation according to the algorithm defined in each observatory, in some cases, these validation algorithms require a some degree of experience, but in others several comments of the same register are required. The file of each environmental variable register can be seen by entering the details of each one of them.</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">Cos4Env has a search system that allows, from a single place and for several citizen observatories at the same time, to consult the records of environmental variables of a certain type or from a specific location, with the possibility of applying criteria to filter the information such as origin, type, license or date. This information can be downloaded in &ldquo;csv&rdquo; format following the Darwin Core (DwC) standard, which is a great advantage for experts who, thanks to Cos4Env, can download the information in a standard used and approved by the community and that without Cos4Env they would find in different formats depending on the citizen observatory.</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">Cos4Env gives visibility to the contribution made by each expert, allowing them to share their profile with information on the comments they have made or their searches and downloads.</span></p>
<h2 class="c8" id="h.7e54jamok5gd"><span class="c3 c4">Main advantages:</span></h2>
<ul class="c9 lst-kix_aaxofqgl484s-0 start">
  <li class="c2 c10 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">Reduce the time that citizen science experts spend on the search and download process.</span></li>
  <li class="c2 c10 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">Allow users to download observations from one portal without forgetting that the platform will recognize and notify each observation&rsquo;s authorship.</span></li>
  <li class="c2 c10 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">Train much better algorithms than if we have separate databases with only the partial information of a single citizen observatory.</span></li>
